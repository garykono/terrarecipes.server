current plan for deleting users:
it seems standard to soft delete users on most websites, especially when users can create content, leave comments, etc.
so if a user deletes their account, set them to inactive and whenever a name is shown on the site for something they made, use the 
	username something like "deleted-user"
anything the user created will stay in the database, and the server can optionally run any scripts that scan the database and delete
	unwanted content (ex. go delete all collections with deleted users every month or so)
